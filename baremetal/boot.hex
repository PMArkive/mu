# Code for the first few disk sectors that all programs in this directory need:
#   - load sectors past the first (using BIOS primitives) since only the first is available by default
#     - if this fails, print 'D' at top-left of screen and halt
#   - initialize a minimal graphics mode
#   - switch to 32-bit mode (giving up access to BIOS primitives)
#   - set up a handler for keyboard events
#   - jump to start of program
#
# To convert to a disk image, first prepare a realistically sized disk image:
#   dd if=/dev/zero of=disk.img count=20160  # 512-byte sectors, so 10MB
# Create initial sectors from this file:
#   ./bootstrap run apps/hex < baremetal/boot.hex > boot.bin
# Translate other sectors into a file called a.img
# Load all sectors into the disk image:
#   cat boot.bin a.img > disk.bin
#   dd if=disk.bin of=disk.img conv=notrunc
# To run:
#   qemu-system-i386 disk.img
# Or:
#   bochs -f baremetal/boot.bochsrc  # boot.bochsrc loads disk.img
#
# Since we start out in 16-bit mode, we need instructions SubX doesn't
# support.
# This file contains just lowercase hex bytes and comments. Zero
# error-checking. Make liberal use of:
#   - comments documenting expected offsets
#   - size checks on the emitted file (currently: 6144 bytes)
#   - xxd to eyeball that offsets contain expected bytes
#
# Programs using this initialization:
#   - can't use any syscalls
#   - can't print text to video memory (past these boot sectors)
#   - must only print raw pixels (256 colors) to video memory (resolution 1024x768)
#   - must start executing immediately after this file (see outline below)

# Outline of this file with offsets and the addresses they map to at run-time:
# -- 16-bit mode code
#   offset    0 (address 7c00): boot code
# -- 16-bit mode data
#            e0 (address 7c80) global descriptor table
#            f8 (address 7ca0) <== gdt_descriptor
# -- 32-bit mode code
#   offset  100 (address 7d00): boot code
#           1fe (address 7dfe) boot sector marker (2 bytes)
#   offset  200 (address 7e00): interrupt handler code
# -- 32-bit mode data
#           2e0 (address 7ee0) <== keyboard buffer
#           2f8 (address 7ef8) <== idt_descriptor
#   offset  300 (address 7f00): video mode data (256 bytes)
#           328 (address 7f28) <== start of video RAM stored here
#   offset  400 (address 8000): interrupt descriptor table (1KB)
#   offset  800 (address 8400): keyboard mappings (2KB)
#   offset 1000 (address 8c00): bitmap font (2KB)
#   offset 1800 (address 9400): entrypoint for applications (don't forget to adjust survey_baremetal if this changes)

# Other details of the current memory map:
#   code: first two default-sized disk tracks into [0x00007c00, 0x00017800)
#   stack grows down from 0x00070000
#     see below
