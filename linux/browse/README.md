## Format restrictions

This is a fairly tiny subset of GitHub-Flavored Markdown. Things supported so
far:

* Newlines are mostly ignored. Double newlines are rendered (paragraphs).
  Newlines followed by indentation are rendered.
* Paragraphs starting with runs of `#` represent headings.
* Within a line, characters between `*`s or `_`s represent bolded text. No
  italics.
