# Mu has no characters, only code points and graphemes.
# Code points are the indivisible atoms of text streams.
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point
# Graphemes are the smallest self-contained unit of text.
# Graphemes may consist of multiple code points.
#
# Mu graphemes are always represented in utf-8, and they are required to fit
# in 4 bytes. (This can be confusing if you focus just on ASCII, where Mu's
# graphemes and code-points are identical.)
#
# Mu doesn't currently support combining code points, or graphemes made of
# multiple code points. One day we will.
