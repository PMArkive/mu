# Demo of combining-character support in Mu, which can be summarized as, "the
# old typewriter-based approach of backing up one character and adding the
# accent or _matra_ in."
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_character
#
# Mu uses this approach for both accents in Latin languages and vowel
# diacritics in Abugida scripts.
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abugida
#
# Steps for trying it out:
#   1. Translate this example into a disk image code.img.
#       ./translate apps/ex15.mu
#   2. Run:
#       qemu-system-i386 -hda code.img -hdb data.img
#
# Expected output: 'Ã ' in green in a few places near the top-left corner of
# screen, showing off what this approach can and cannot do.

fn main screen: (addr screen), keyboard: (addr keyboard), data-disk: (addr disk) {
  # at the top of screen, the accent is almost cropped
